Excited to share my latest Sample Tableau project! 📊

The Netflix Dashboard in Tableau provides a clear and interactive view of Netflix data, helping to analyze trends in movies, TV shows, genres, release years, and ratings.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Netflix Dashboard:

🟦 Rating :- The rating analysis highlights how movies and shows are categorized into TV-MA, TV-14, R, PG, PG-13, and TV-Y ratings, giving insights into audience preferences and age suitability. Users can filter by year, type (Movie/TV Show), and genre to explore trends in Netflix’s global library. The dashboard helps understand which content rating dominates, how ratings vary across regions, and which categories attract the most viewers. It is an excellent tool for analyzing audience segmentation and content strategy.

🟦 Duration :-  The duration analysis compares movie lengths (in minutes) and TV shows (by number of seasons), helping to identify whether Netflix focuses more on short, medium, or long-form content.
